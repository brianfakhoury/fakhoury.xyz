Dearest web surfer, you've come knocking on my digital door — welcome. I built this site for your curiosity and my own tinkering. Feel free to explore the links below or dive into my <Link href="/writing">writing archive</Link>.

These days, I'm helping grow **Mach Industries**, a defense tech company. But I've always valued time to think, create, and court serendipity. That's why I built this site by hand and optimized it beyond reasonable utility. You're welcome to linger as long as you like. If you do, I invite you to view my work and writing through a few personal lenses:

1. I want to take on challenges just beyond my current abilities.
2. I believe in maximizing one's natural strengths.
3. Technology is engraved deeply in me; I appreciate it for its quality, possibility, and existence.
