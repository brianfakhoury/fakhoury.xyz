It's 12:58 PM and I send a message to you. Because you are in a different timezone, the message is timestamped 2:58 PM. Say next week were daylight savings, if I had waited until then, perhaps it would've been 1:58 PM for me and 3:58 PM for you. Or if you were in Arizona where there's not daylight savings, it would have been 2:58 PM for you still.

Clock time is clearly an artificial construct. It's purpose was to synchronize asynchronous systems, like trains and human meetings. But it is hardly coded into our nature. The rough similarities to our circadian rhythm, just as a 24-hour cycle, and midnight happening during our sleep, is actually detrimental from a personal standpoint. I want artificial time to be used for external coordination only, and sunrise/sunset to be used for all personal things. Let me explain.
