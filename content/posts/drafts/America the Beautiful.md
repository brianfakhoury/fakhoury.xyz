title: America the Beautiful
series:
---
The United States is a special place to those that are fortunate to live here. It's a vast land and a nexus of opportunity. I've heard the phrase "America the Beautiful" in all contexts. It's something I'm familiar with, and surely I agree. I've seen enough pictures to be convinced of the beautiful nature of the land and the will of those that inhabit it. But experiencing it is something entirely different. Experience is taking it in for yourself, not through the editorialization of another person. People tell stories, a lot. And the stories of nature are always some of the oldest. We strive to model the awe that overtakes us when we experience the world. Perhaps language as a technology has found its oldest use case in this endeavor. This is not to say it's an aimless pursuit. The best writers of our time and of other eras have swept countless readers away with their colorful descriptions of our world. It's enticing. Entertaining. But it's not the real thing, and one's perception of richness can only be enhanced by taking action on this dialectic. Read about the world, perceive the world, change the world. These are all complementary, non-overlapping pursuits. It's the gestalt that is worth it.

I've been incredibly fortunate to experience the many corners of the country. If you're familiar with our explorations, you'll know I'm of course talking about our van. My entire life until the time spent in the van is a complement to my van travels. One of these is inherently stationary, no matter how much travel is done. One is inherently adventurous, no matter how still you stay. As we've circled the inlands to the coast and back again, I've many times felt the gratitude and awe that makes me want to write this piece, to relay my experience of what is uniquely enabled by an intersection of 21st century technology and the eternal American landscape. It's an honor. It's also something I hope others continue to experience for long into the future.

## Hard Work

American values enshrine hard work. Americans work hard. We've had a history of consistency between the input of work and the output of reward, something that has long been too variable in other societies. You can count on it here. We have deeply bound this social contract, written in the constitution (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) and echoed it on a daily basis across our media. It's not going anywhere anytime soon, no matter how unstable things might seem at times.

In part, this has led to the foundation of an infrastructure that makes travel around the country reliable and easy. In fact, American automobiles from their inception were built lighter than their European counterparts due to the promise of developed roadways[^1]. I've driven in areas of extreme weather variation, food deserts, and remoteness. Every time, the winding freeways, grocery supply chains, Starlink satellites, water spigots, fuel stations, national forest access, and so much more have quietly supported an undertaking that explorers as recently as the last century could hardly imagine not stressing about.

In fact, the hardest thing about my travels has been trying to systematize the discovery of beautiful areas to enjoy. I spend a lot of time on satellite view and forums trying to find places to park and enjoy the scenery. After a long period of driving, turning onto a bumpy dirt road with no end in sight and potential hazards is the final push before what is often rewarded with an unmatched scenery. I do consider this hard work, but of course it pales in comparison to the shoulders we stand on.

## National Parks

Two centuries ago, Yellowstone overcame many hearts and minds to become the first national park in the US, a designation we take for granted now. Influential visitors, explorers in their own right, recognized the value in preserving the intactness of such beauty. During the in-between period, another 63 national parks were set aside for public enjoyment. 

As we've visited well over a dozen parks, it's become clear that this system is truly built for enjoyment. The parks are centered around the nature, and the visitor center, with it's films and displays, prime you for what might capture your attention when you're driving or hiking through the wilderness of the park. Perhaps a brief recount, in incomplete sentences, of the parks we've recently enjoyed will help illustrate the span to which these spaces encompass.

### Rocky Mountain

Not too far from Denver, sloping and jarring. Exposed rock faces and sweeping forests below. Crowded in August, but serene. Hours of travel between the sides of the park, trying to avoid some recently burnt areas. The highest paved road in North America, from summer to winter when driving on it.

### Grand Teton

Young and jagged, the smaller version of Rocky Mountain. Stunning immediate plains below the rocks. Hikes quickly become hard, lack of foothills. Crazy views when parking in nearby national forests.

### Yellowstone

Caldera, the depressed earth from too much volcanic activity, is forested yet otherworldly. Plumes of smoke give a steampunk feel, minus the punk. Herds of buffalo wandering around, often blocking roads.

### Glacier

Perhaps a good metaphor for a piece of heaven on Earth. A swept and molded landscape (from the glaciers), filled with colors, vegetation, and dramatic sunlight. 

### North Cascades



### Mount Rainier



### Olympic



### Crater Lake



### Arches



### Canyonlands



### Capitol Reef



### Bryce Canyon



### Zion



### Grand Canyon



### Petrified Forest



### White Sands



### Guadalupe Mountains




## Animals

On a cold morning as dawn emerged, we were driving in [Glacier National Park](https://rollingtogether.substack.com/p/glacier-national-park) when we spotted a black bear and her cubs foraging near the roadway. This one of our first major animal sightings, that would be followed by sheep, wolves, other bears, eagles, and more.

The fauna are an iceberg in the landscape, such little of it is actually viewable. You know it's there though, and that is why you are excited when you see a representative of a species. You are capturing a hint of what is silently crawling around the landscape.

## Light

Light is the best disinfectant. It also mediates experience, especially in nature. Light, or the absence of, will paint, shape, and filter the presentation of the entire day. For example, the [alpenglow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpenglow) on the mountains right before sunrise shifts the grandeur to one that is more soft and comforting. Whereas in the middle of the day,  perhaps with the backdrop of overcast skies, those same mountains create a sense of looming.

Perhaps even more extreme is the night, where the sway of dominance between moonlight, starlight, and pitch black create such different feelings. On the brightest moonlit nights, you can see your own shadow as you take in a fairly clear scene around you. Though color is lacking, a moonlit landscape is rightfully beautiful. In that same way, the nights where there is no moon are dominated by a curtain of stars. This envelopment of celestial bodies is perhaps one of the most detailed things you can ever see. Stargazing is a timeless and endless pursuit. Where you study one spot, and find endlessly more. Or maybe you step back and take in the entire sky, the distances are of course nothing we can fathom, yet we try. That process of trying is, I believe, therapeutic. It brings us fully out of the minutia within ourselves. It balances us.

Light is also a grand tool when traveling around. The first light in the morning winds your internal clock, starting a countdown to a later sleep. This same light warms our van, informs our dress for hikes, and of course illuminates the nature outside the windows as we enjoy our tiny home.

## Distance

To be an ant must be an extreme experience. You spend hours crossing a field, susceptible to the crushing power of an animal's paw or the torrential might of wind and rain. You return with baggage at least the size of your body, and must follow unsaid instructions to an unlikely precision, harmonizing with thousands of comrades. Distance is just the game you've been dealt, and the heights in your surroundings are unfathomable.

We are clearly ants in the backcountry of America. Open plains can take hours to traverse by high speed vehicle, walks to the summit of a peak are a day-long endeavor. And what ants often miss is the volume of their endeavor, literally. To travel hundreds of yards on a two dimensional plane only helps you imagine just how much *stuff* exists when you add one more dimension.

Take Crater Lake for example, the water-logged basin of a collapsed volcano that once stood over 12,000 feet in the air, now the location of the deepest lake in North America. Humanities ability to terraform might take centuries to ever get near this level of *moving stuff*. This magnitude of geological processes is the norm, and has some story in every part of the states. Although the great distances are always there, it's the geology that sculpts the marble of Earth into something that is perceivable to us. Otherwise, a dirt plain stretching as far as the horizon might not elicit the same reaction.

## How to

As days turned into weeks of exploration, I began to formalize what I think is the optimal strategy for experiencing the natural scape by van. It's hard to achieve balance. Search and satisfaction, hot and cold, green and brown, distance and granularity, and so on. Resources, like time and attention, are limited. Serendipity is expected, and discomfort is unexpected. If the objective is to experience the world, as it is, then the strategy is to move great distances sometimes, and at other times to be deeply curious about the same area. In fact, this method is mimicked in nature, sometimes referred to as a [Levy Walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_flight). This is best visualized by thinking about how an insect moves around, often buzzing in the same spot randomly, before picking up and moving across an entire field, and then resuming the random buzzing around an area.

For us, the great moves were between the waypoints of National Parks and cities where we saw friends and family. And between these great moves, we often parked in different spots every night, giving us access in the day to new surroundings and experiences. Broadly, this was our strategy. Some of our tactics were as follows:

- **Museums and visitor centers** before exploring a park prime our attention to what make the area great. What often might be uninteresting at first is presented in new light by local displays.
- **Longer hikes** for a more rewarding and closer encounter with nature. 6-12 miles was ideal for us. Shorter hikes for a quicker stop are just as important though.
- **Coffee shops** break up the stuffiness of being in the van on computer-focused days. They're also a glimpse of local culture.
- **iOverlander**, the app, to highlight areas of plentiful views and free camping. Satellite view on traditional maps helps you estimate the qualities of a parking area. Paper maps provide the best sense of an area.
- **National Forests** are just as valuable as the parks due to their numerous backcountry roads and less-visited views.
- **Dusk and dawn** are the time to see the animals of an area.
- Very occasionally, a **random country road** might be an oasis of a stop.
- Mid 40s at night was the **ideal temperature** to chase, any colder and the motive to head south should increase. This is for fall heading into winter, the opposite advice is true for spring heading into summer.
- **The gym** is a reset, use the exercise as therapy and the shower as a refreshment. America is better when your body is ready.
- This might be controversial, but we almost visited **zero restaurants**. Cooking food was the routine, and being in control of that supported our wellbeing and energy to meet the demands of nature.

These tactics are just an example, and often people will develop their own for their style of travel. But the strategy, in my opinion and given the same objective, should be constant. Too much straight travel and the experience will be a blur. Too much stillness and you will loose the novelty. Of course, stillness is a virtue in it's own right. As the practitioners of zen know well, the ability to forever find attention in the mundane is a superpower. But if your objective is to experience the beauty of America, then stillness is not the scarce resource. Stillness can be achieved anywhere. American landscape is a continuum, a saccade for the soul. Your eyes cannot see something without moving the image across the retina, and in the same way you cannot see America without passing through the forests, deserts, rivers, salt flats, snow fields, highways, towns, and seasons. To search is to eventually satisfy, but to satisfy is the slowest way to search.
