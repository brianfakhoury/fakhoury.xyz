# Page 19 thinking means creating a version of something and asking someone to help you make it better

Seth Godin gives the example of working on page 19 in his community-created almanac. They knew page 19 would exist, but they also accepted that no one person knows exactly how to create it. Instead, page 19 was created iteratively, with no blame, just making edits and passing it off to the next person to make it better.
