# Use a calendar instead of a todo list

Moving tasks from a to-do list to a calendar with estimated time frames helps to realize the finite nature of time. 

By organizing tasks in a calendar, individuals can better visualize their time constraints and allocate appropriate time slots for each task. Having around 50% open space in a day allows for unexpected events and interruptions.

Over time, one can develop the skill to accurately estimate task durations, reducing the need for excess open space.

This concept of maintaining open space in a schedule is derived from manufacturing practices to ensure efficient operation by accommodating unexpected events without disrupting the entire schedule.
