# Technology is built to solve a problem, but when it isn't also built to be beautiful as well, we will occasionally suffer from it

People benefit from technology when it comes to necessities like food, clothing, and shelter. But now that people have been benefiting for quite a while, and their needs are met, it's potentially important to look at the aesthetics of technology. By  ensuring that technology is built in a beautiful way, we can avoid instances where a cold machine does something that we would consider "blind" and "ugly" traditionally.
