# Diagonalization defined early complexity theory

Early complexity theory, referred to as the age of "Diagonalosaurs," relied on Cantor's diagonal argument to show the uncomputability of certain problems. This era focused on proving limits on computation but lacked tools to address more nuanced classes like P and NP.
