# Learn to associate reward with effort

The key to achieving goals is to tap into your internally generated reward system.  
By consciously attaching feelings of friction and effort to your efforts, you can train your brain to find pleasure in the process. This misolimbic reward pathway encompasses all types of effort, not just external rewards like trophies or grades. Embrace the pain and tell yourself that it will lead to a greater release of dopamine later on.
