# If all you do is repeat things, you will never be able to write about things that you don't remember

As Pirsig explained, someone who hadn't heard anything worth repeating about Bozeman, MT would be unable to write anything about the town because they were unable to recall.

This makes perfect sense in the context of being a writer, the goal is to generate new ideas, not just regurgitate old ones.
