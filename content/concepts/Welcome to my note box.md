# Welcome to my note box

There's no top-down structure here. Everything is a web that must be traversed through related ideas. This note serves as an unbiased entry to this web.

Right now, one of the most in-depth areas of this network can be found in the philosophy index: [[§ General Philosophies]].

I also recommend seeing [[The Way of Myself]] as another alternative to starting a perusing journey.
