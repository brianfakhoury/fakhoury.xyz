# A rigid designator refers to the same object in every version of the world it exists

- **Examples**: Proper names ("Aristotle"), natural kind terms ("water" = H₂O).
- **Contrast**: Non-rigid designators (e.g., "the inventor of bifocals") can refer to different objects in different possible worlds.
- **Importance**: Challenges descriptivist theories of reference; names refer directly without descriptive content.
