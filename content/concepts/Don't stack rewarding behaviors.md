# Don't stack rewarding behaviors

When engaging in activities, be careful about allowing yourself to experience huge peaks in dopamine, as it leads to a crash and longer recovery time. To maintain motivation, vary the amount of dopamine you experience with each engagement in an activity and avoid relying on external sources to increase dopamine. Some activities naturally have this intermittent property.
