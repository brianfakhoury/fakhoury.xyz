# Category mistake

A category mistake is an error that people make in assigning the wrong category to things. Marc Andreessen refers to a category mistake in [[Why AI Will Save the World by Marc Andreessen]]. The example he gives is assigning to AI the property of deciding to kill everyone. This can be seen as a category mistake as AI does not have a mind of it's own, and will therefore only kill if the people who control it allow it to do so. This is also the same ontology to the gun safety debate.
