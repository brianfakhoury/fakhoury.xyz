# Invent a character that you want to be when it comes to being your best, turn that mode on when certain conditions are met

Three steps:
1. Identify the situations where you'd like to show up as the best version of yourself
2. Envision the character you would like to embody in each situation
3. Get yourself some reps by turning on this character in those situations.

This process is meant to help attenuate the ability to become the best version of yourself.
