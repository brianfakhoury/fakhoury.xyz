# People remember selfish actions more often

Rooted in our instinct to protect our community, negativity bias extends all the way into communication and gossip. Selfish actions are more likely to be highlighted.

Classic work in psychology, going back to the 1950s, shows that if you teach somebody about a new person who they've never met and you list three positive qualities that this person has and three negative qualities, people will very much judge the person on their worst qualities.
