# Cynicism is stagnant, skepticism is dynamic

Cynicism is a rigid (and naive) belief in the inherent issues in people. Cynics will seek data to back support their case, dismissing good acts as having ulterior motives, and ultimately restricting your opportunities.

Skepticism is a healthy pursuit of new information and challenging of assumptions. Skepticism can facilitate better learning and better relationships.
