# Questions to ask yourself during trying times

- How is the discomfort you’re facing right now going to help you grow? 
- How can you make this experience more immediately rewarding?
- What evidence do you have that you can handle this?  
- What resources do you have—strengths, preparation, or social support—that can help you rise to the demands of your current challenge?
- Have people survived this challenge or similar ones in the past? How did they respond?   

Also, try asking yourself those questions with some self-distancing by using the word “you” or your own name.
