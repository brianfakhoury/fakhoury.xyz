# Talking to yourself in third person helps reduce feelings of nervousness and can increase performance

In an example given, performance in front of judges by a group of people that used distanced self-talk resulted in superior performance and less counterproductive thoughts due to nervousness.

The same effect is useful in the following as well:
- Meeting strangers
- Self-control and sticking to a healthy diet
- Viewing future stressors as a challenge instead
- More forgiving and less blameful arguments between couples

On a neurological level, emotional activity is dampened when talking to yourself in third-person, physically allowing you to perform better and persevere longer.
