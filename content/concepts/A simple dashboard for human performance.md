# A simple dashboard for human performance

Based on [[Andrew Huberman's main protocols]] and [[Anything that increases the speed of aging is self-destructive]]. Here is what I think you can boil down the main performance indicators of healthiness to:
### Sleep
- TIme spent asleep
- Quality of sleep
### Nutrition
- Calories consumed
- Vitamins and minerals consumed
### Work
- Time spent in deep work on most important goals
- Progress toward most important goal
### Happiness
- Time spent with people you love
- Time spent with yourself and your own thoughts
### Wealth
- Durable income and amount invested
- Amount of debt
### Fitness
- Number of steps
- Time spent in rigorous exercise
