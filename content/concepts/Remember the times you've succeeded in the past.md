# Remember the times you've succeeded in the past

When you've been through something hard before and made it through, it serves as a powerful tool for bringing up in future hard moments to motivate and convince yourself that you can push through. [[You are likely to believe the things that you hope for]].

In fact, the challenge response switch that flips in this mindset literally reduces cortisol and boosts testosterone. Basically, the challenge mindset is a performance enhancing drug. Confidence, focus, resilience... this is what stress can be like when it's experienced as an energizing challenge.

This is why it's important to remember the evidence of times you've succeeded, it allows you to perceive the situation as a challenge as you know you have the resources to handle it.

Examples of evidence:
- Focusing on your strengths
- Thinking about how you have prepared for a particular challenge
- Imagining the support of your team, friends, and/or loved ones
- The knowledge that others are praying for you
- The fact that others have succeeded at this in the past
