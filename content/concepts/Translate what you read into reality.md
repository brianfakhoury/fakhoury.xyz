# Translate what you read into reality

Richard Feynman, growing up, would observe his father always translating what they read about into a practical reality. For example, when they heard about the size of some dinosaurs, he would talk about how big that was compared to their house. 

The point is that you should try to what things really mean, not just taking words at face value. Connect and turn everything into an analogy.
