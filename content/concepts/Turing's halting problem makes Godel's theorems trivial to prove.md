# Turing's halting problem makes Godel's theorems trivial to prove

- **Assume a Formal F**: Suppose we have a formal system F that is both consistent and powerful enough to express arithmetic.
- **Encoding Programs**: We can encode computer programs and their execution within F. Using the formalism of F, we can express statements about whether a program halts.
- **Construct a Gödel Sentence**: Construct a statement within F that essentially says, "This statement is unprovable within F." This is analogous to constructing a program that tries to decide whether it halts based on the Halting Problem's principles.
- **Undecidability**: Using the Halting Problem's undecidability, we can show that there are statements about the halting of programs that F cannot decide, implying that there are true statements in F that F cannot prove.
