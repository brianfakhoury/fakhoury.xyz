# Creativity is a backed up water pipe, it has to be emptied before the fresh water can flow

"Julian's Creativity Faucet" -- The wastewater in the pipe must be emptied before fresh water can come. This means that when it comes to idea, you must first empty the bad ones to then get to the good ones.

This probably happens because a lot of the bad idea are just things you've heard and are repeating. You realize after the fact that they lack creativity.

This is also similar to something Seth Godin says about do the work, have the bad ideas, the good ones will come.
