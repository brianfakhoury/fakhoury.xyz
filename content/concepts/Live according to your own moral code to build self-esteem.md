# Live according to your own moral code to build self-esteem

Because you are intimately aware of how you act, both in the present and in the past, you are able to perceive a reputation of yourself. It is important to have a good reputation, without it you will have low self-esteem because you don't believe in yourself or don't trust yourself.

By rigorously setting a standard and adhering to it, you will be proud of yourself, even without external opinion or validation, and therefore have confidence and high self-esteem.
