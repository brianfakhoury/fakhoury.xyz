# Embrace chance social interactions

Actual experiences often surpass initial negative expectations, highlighting the importance of engaging more fully.

It’s essential to confront risks and embrace chance interactions, as positive outcomes can emerge from challenging discussions.

Additionally, documenting these experiences and their effects—termed 'encounter counting'—is crucial for long-term understanding and learning.

Reflecting on social encounters that defy expectations enhances awareness and enriches relationships, encouraging proactive engagement in potentially divisive topics.
