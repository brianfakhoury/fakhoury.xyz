# Cold water exposure is a behavioral tool that increases dopamine

Through behaviors alone, without the use of drugs, cold water exposure can lead to significant and sustained increases in dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. 

This increase in dopamine can have various benefits, including increasing metabolism and fat loss, improving well-being, cognition, and clarity of mind. Cold water exposure creates a highly alert yet calm state of mind, which is optimal for work, social engagement, and sports.  

These dopamine increases can last for a long time and can be achieved by correctly practicing cold water therapy.
