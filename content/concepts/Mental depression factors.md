# Mental Depression Factors

1. **Disconnection from Meaningful Work**: Those with the least control and authority in the workplace are more likely to experience depression. Having a sense of purpose in what we do is crucial.
2. **Disconnection from Others**: Loneliness and a lack of belonging are significant indicators of depression.
3. **Disconnection from Meaningful Values**: A consumer-driven society can lead to a detachment from worthwhile values, contributing to depression.
4. **Childhood Trauma**: A 1998 study found that individuals with more traumatic childhoods are more likely to experience depression and anxiety.
5. **Disconnection from Status**: In areas with larger wealth gaps, such as the US, there are higher rates of depression.
6. **Disconnection from Nature**: People living in greener neighborhoods tend to feel less stress and despair.
7. **Disconnection from a Secure and Hopeful Future**: Native Americans on government-controlled reservations had higher suicide rates. In contrast, those on reservations with control over their own laws, elections, police, and schools had lower rates, indicating a link between control over one's destiny and mental health.
8. **Genetic Influence**: Genetics play a role in depression, accounting for about 37% of cases.
9. **Changes in the Brain**: Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change from experience, means that focusing more on despair rather than joy can strengthen negative thought patterns.
