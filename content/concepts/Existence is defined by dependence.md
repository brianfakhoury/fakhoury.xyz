# Existence is defined by dependence

If the system in which the thing "exists" cannot function without the thing, then the thing must exist. This applies to the real world where one cannot deny the existence of something if the disappearance of that thing would cause something to change.

An example that comes to mind is bacteria in the gut microbiome.
