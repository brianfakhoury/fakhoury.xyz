# [[Andrew Huberman]]'s main protocols

- Caffeine has a reinforcing effect on things that we do. Consuming [[caffeine]] (1-3mg per kilogram of body weight) will increase your ability to like whatever it is you are doing.
- Eat 25g of fiber per day. This is for health and longevity. Also eat 500-60g of fruits and/or vegetables.
- Don't train for too long. Keep workouts to under an hour for the most part to prevent unecessary amounts of cortisol.
- Take 5g of [[creatine]] a day.
- Eat 0.7g-1g of [[protein]] per pound of bodyweight per day.
- Stretch consistently, and don't stretch too hard. Benefits include balance and posture, reduced inflamation, and smoother athletic performance.
- Optimal focus time windows occur in periods of 90 minutes.
- After 8 hours of waking, you cognitive work ability will decline.
- Don't go for more than 3 major goals per year.
- Eat low-sugar [[fermented foods]].
- [[Sauna]] once a week is good. Improve muscle recovery and growth horomone.
- Use active recall and spaced repetition to learn things
- Use the [[physiological sigh]] to lower stress.
- A large spike in [[dopamine]] will result in a lowered baseline afterward.
- Use [[random, intermittent reinforcement]] to offset baseline drops. This means celebrate some wins, but not all of them.
- Dopamine release is partially influenced by mindset
- Layering sources of dopamine will make it harder to be consistently motivated.
- Minimum of 5 minutes of [[sunlight exposure]] within 30 minutes of waking up.
- Avoid bright lights between 10pm and 4am
- Sleep in a dark, cool room.
