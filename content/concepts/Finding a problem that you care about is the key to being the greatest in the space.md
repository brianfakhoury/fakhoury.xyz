# Finding a problem that you care about is the key to being genuine and committed 

Working on things that you care about gives you a boost in genuineness. This lets you work on things for more than 5 days a week, not feel like it's work, and make the process of selling easier. All this to say -- find your problem, not your passion. Passions come and go, but problems are sticky, and they build expertise over time.
